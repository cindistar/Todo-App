# Todo App with Flutter

A Todo App is generally used to maintain our day-to-day tasks or list everything that we have to do with priority.
It is helpful in planning our daily schedules.

# App Overview
  
The application is a classic TODO App with CRUD: create (add),  read, update and delete functions.
It also includes a chip flag showing the priority level (low, medium or high), a date picker for selecting
the date and a checkbox in order to mark each todo as completed.
